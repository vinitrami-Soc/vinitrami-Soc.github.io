"""The four extraction bugs the multi-format corpus found.

Each of these shipped. None was caught by the eight hand-written extractor tests
that existed before, because each needs a log shape those eight did not contain.
They are pinned individually here so a regression names the bug rather than a
percentage; `test_extraction_corpus.py` holds the aggregate.

# The README promises "RFC1918, loopback and CGNAT space are dropped before

# as private, so it was reaching the providers: a customer's carrier-grade NAT
# address, spending quota and telling a vendor nothing.

# those positions is a file. A bare token scraped out of a log line is not, so
